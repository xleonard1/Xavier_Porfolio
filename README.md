# Xavier_Porfolio

This updated portfolio now includes dynamically generated javascript elements, updated CSS, Bootstrap and the most recent projects I have engaged in. The page now features a working input field, and a modal to confirm the user's input has been recieved. The portfolio has also been formatted to be mobile friendly.
